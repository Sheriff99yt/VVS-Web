# VVS Web

VVS Web is a visual programming environment for web development, allowing users to create applications through a node-based interface without writing code directly.

## Features

- **Visual Node-Based Programming**: Create programs by connecting nodes in a visual flow
- **Python Support**: Generate Python code from your visual programs
- **Real-Time Code Generation**: See the generated code as you build your visual program
- **Extensible Node System**: Comprehensive function library with:
  - Mathematical operations
  - String manipulation
  - List processing
  - Dictionary operations
  - File operations
  - Control flow with execution paths
- **Type Validation**: Robust type checking system with:
  - Connection compatibility validation
  - Automatic type conversion
  - Visual error highlighting
  - Validation message panel
- **Example Programs**: Learn from pre-built examples

## Current Status

VVS Web is currently in active development. We have completed the simplified MVP and are working on enhancing the system with more advanced features:

- âœ… Basic node-based editor
- âœ… Data flow connections
- âœ… Comprehensive function library
- âœ… Execution flow with conditional branching
- âœ… Type validation and conversion system
- ðŸ”„ Project management features (current focus)
- ðŸ“… UI enhancements

## Function Library

VVS Web includes a comprehensive function library:

### Mathematical Functions
- Basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Advanced math (min, max, abs, round)

### String Functions
- Manipulation (concat, split, join, replace)
- Formatting (uppercase, lowercase, trim)

### List Functions
- Operations (map, filter, reduce)
- Manipulation (sort, reverse, slice)

### Dictionary Functions
- Creation and manipulation (create, get, set)
- Advanced operations (keys, values, items)

### File Functions
- File handling (open, read, write, close)
- File system operations (exists, delete)

### Control Flow
- Conditional branching (if/else)
- Loops (for, while)
- Execution flow management

## Type Validation System

The type validation system ensures proper data flow between nodes:

- **Real-time Type Checking**: Validates connections between nodes as they are created
- **Visual Feedback**: Highlights incompatible connections with color-coded error indicators
- **Automatic Type Conversion**: Intelligently converts between compatible types when needed
- **Type Conversion Nodes**: Specialized nodes for explicit type conversion
- **Validation Messages**: Displays warnings and errors with detailed information
- **Code Generation Integration**: Automatically inserts necessary type conversions in generated code

## Execution Flow System

The execution flow system allows for more complex program structures with conditional branching and sequential execution:

- **Execution Ports**: Nodes can have execution input and output ports that define the flow of execution
- **Conditional Branching**: If/else nodes allow for different execution paths based on conditions
- **Sequential Execution**: Define the exact order in which operations should be performed
- **Code Generation**: The execution-based code generator produces clean, structured code that follows the defined execution flow

## Available Scripts

- `npm start`: Run the development server
- `npm test`: Run the test suite
- `npm run build`: Build for production
