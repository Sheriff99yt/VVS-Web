## Notes

- Each testing phase is critical - we should not proceed to the next implementation phase until all tests pass
- Document all issues found during testing in the issue tracker
- Update this tracking document after each testing phase with results summary
- Performance metrics should be recorded at each testing phase to track improvements or regressions
