# VVS Web Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the VVS Web project, including the types of tests, testing tools, and best practices for ensuring code quality.

## Testing Goals

The primary goals of our testing strategy are to:

1. **Ensure Functionality**: Verify that all features work as expected
2. **Prevent Regressions**: Catch issues before they affect users
3. **Maintain Code Quality**: Enforce coding standards and best practices
4. **Document Behavior**: Tests serve as executable documentation
5. **Support Refactoring**: Enable safe code changes and improvements

## Testing Levels

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation:

- **Scope**: Individual functions, classes, and methods
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Location**: `src/tests/` directory, co-located with the code being tested
- **Naming Convention**: `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx`

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different components work together correctly:

- **Scope**: Interactions between multiple components or services
- **Focus Areas**: Database operations, code generation pipeline, UI component interactions
- **Location**: `src/tests/integration/` directory

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests validate complete user workflows:

- **Scope**: Full application workflows from UI to code generation
- **Tools**: Cypress
- **Location**: `cypress/` directory
- **Focus**: Critical user journeys and workflows

## Test Organization

Tests are organized by major system components:

```
src/tests/
├── codeGen/              # Code generation tests
│   ├── DependencyResolver.test.ts
│   ├── ExecutionBasedCodeGenerator.test.ts
│   ├── SyntaxPatternApplication.test.ts
│   └── ExportService.test.ts
├── database/             # Database tests
│   ├── SyntaxDatabaseService.test.ts
│   ├── FunctionDefinitionService.test.ts
│   └── ...
├── ui/                   # UI component tests
│   ├── NodeCanvas.test.tsx
│   ├── NodeLibrary.test.tsx
│   └── ...
├── utils/                # Utility function tests
└── mocks/                # Mock implementations for testing
```

## Testing Approach

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

For critical components, we follow a TDD approach:

1. Write a failing test that defines the expected behavior
2. Implement the minimum code needed to pass the test
3. Refactor the code while keeping tests passing

### Mocking and Test Doubles

We use mocks and test doubles to isolate components:

- **Mock Services**: For database and external services
- **Stub Components**: For UI component dependencies
- **Fake Objects**: For complex data structures

### Test Coverage

We aim for high test coverage of critical components:

- **Code Generation**: 90%+ coverage
- **Database Services**: 90%+ coverage
- **UI Components**: 80%+ coverage
- **Utility Functions**: 90%+ coverage

## Testing Best Practices

1. **Isolated Tests**: Tests should not depend on each other
2. **Fast Execution**: Tests should run quickly to encourage frequent testing
3. **Readable Tests**: Tests should clearly express intent and expected behavior
4. **Maintainable Tests**: Tests should be easy to update when requirements change
5. **Deterministic Tests**: Tests should produce the same results on each run

## Continuous Integration

Tests are automatically run in CI/CD pipelines:

1. **Pull Request Checks**: All tests must pass before merging
2. **Coverage Reports**: Test coverage is reported for each build
3. **Linting**: Code style and quality checks are enforced

## Test Data Management

We manage test data through:

1. **Fixtures**: Predefined test data stored in JSON files
2. **Factories**: Functions that generate test data
3. **Seeding**: Database seeding for integration tests
4. **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup after tests

## Testing UI Components

UI component testing follows these principles:

1. **Render Testing**: Verify components render correctly
2. **Interaction Testing**: Test user interactions like clicks and inputs
3. **State Testing**: Verify component state changes correctly
4. **Snapshot Testing**: Used sparingly for stable components

## Testing Code Generation

Code generation testing focuses on:

1. **Dependency Resolution**: Verify correct execution order
2. **Syntax Pattern Application**: Test pattern substitution
3. **Code Structure**: Verify generated code structure and indentation
4. **Edge Cases**: Test circular dependencies, missing patterns, etc.

## Performance Testing

Performance testing ensures the application remains responsive:

1. **Large Node Graphs**: Test with 50+ nodes
2. **Database Operations**: Verify database performance with large datasets
3. **UI Responsiveness**: Test UI performance during complex operations

## Accessibility Testing

We test for accessibility compliance:

1. **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all features are keyboard accessible
2. **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Test with screen readers
3. **Color Contrast**: Verify sufficient contrast for readability

## Security Testing

Security testing focuses on:

1. **Input Validation**: Test handling of unexpected inputs
2. **Data Storage**: Verify secure storage of user data
3. **Code Execution**: Ensure safe handling of generated code

## Test Documentation

Each test file should include:

1. **Purpose**: What the tests are verifying
2. **Test Structure**: How the tests are organized
3. **Mock Setup**: How dependencies are mocked
4. **Edge Cases**: Special cases being tested

## Conclusion

This testing strategy provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring the quality and reliability of the VVS Web application. By following these guidelines, we can maintain high code quality, prevent regressions, and support ongoing development and refactoring.
