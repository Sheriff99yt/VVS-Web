# VVS Web Development Roadmap

## Current Focus
**Keyboard Shortcuts Implementation**

## Current Development Status
The Simplified MVP plan has been completed, and we have successfully expanded the function library with string manipulation, list operations, mathematical functions, dictionary operations, and file handling functions. We have also implemented the execution flow system with conditional branching, allowing for more complex program structures. We've completed the type validation and conversion system, providing users with better error handling and compatibility between different data types. Additionally, we have implemented a comprehensive project management system that allows users to save, load, import, and export projects. We have organized the node library by categories, making it easier for users to find and use the various node types in the system. We've enhanced the node styling with better visual hierarchy, color-coding based on category, and improved interactivity. We've also implemented smart connection routing with improved visual feedback, context menus, and validity indicators.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Simplified MVP (COMPLETED)
- âœ… Basic UI with node-based editor
- âœ… Simple function nodes (math, string operations)
- âœ… Data connections between nodes
- âœ… Basic code generation for Python
- âœ… Simple examples (calculator, string formatter)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Function Library (COMPLETED)
- âœ… Expand function library
  - âœ… String manipulation (split, join, replace)
  - âœ… List operations (filter, map, sort)
  - âœ… Mathematical functions (min, max, abs)
  - âœ… Dictionary operations (create, get, set)
  - âœ… File handling (open, read, write, close, exists)

### Phase 3: Execution Flow and Advanced Features (IN PROGRESS)
- âœ… Add execution flow system
  - âœ… Design document for execution flow
  - âœ… Execution ports in node UI
  - âœ… Execution-based code generator
  - âœ… Conditional branching (if/else)
  - âœ… Example demonstrating execution flow
- âœ… Improve type validation and connection handling
  - âœ… Type checking for connections
  - âœ… Type conversion system
  - âœ… Error highlighting for incompatible connections
  - âœ… Validation messages UI
- âœ… Add project management features
  - âœ… Save/load projects
  - âœ… Project import/export
  - âœ… Project organization UI
  - âœ… Project metadata handling
