# VVS Web Simplified MVP Progress Report

This document tracks the implementation progress of the simplified MVP version of VVS Web.

## Current Status: Early Development

We are transitioning to a simplified MVP approach to deliver a working version more quickly. This approach reduces the scope to focus on the core functionality needed to create basic visual programs that generate Python code.

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (0% Complete)

#### Week 1: Basic Framework (0% Complete)
- [ ] Set up simplified JSON-based function definitions (10-15 essential functions)
- [ ] Create `FunctionDefinitionService` for loading and retrieving definitions
- [ ] Implement basic node canvas with React Flow
- [ ] Create minimal `FunctionNode` component

#### Week 2: Essential Connections (0% Complete)
- [ ] Implement basic connections between nodes
- [ ] Add simplified data flow validation
- [ ] Create basic `NodeLibrary` component with essential functions
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop for node creation

### Phase 2: Code Generation (0% Complete)

#### Week 3: Basic Code Generator (0% Complete)
- [ ] Implement minimal code generator that follows connections
- [ ] Create simple `CodePreview` component
- [ ] Add export functionality for Python files

#### Week 4: Essential Polish (0% Complete)
- [ ] Fix critical visual issues
- [ ] Ensure basic functionality works end-to-end
- [ ] Create simple example programs
- [ ] Write minimal usage documentation

## Recent Accomplishments

- Created simplified MVP plan with reduced scope
- Developed detailed implementation guide with code examples
- Cleaned up old documentation files
- Aligned project documentation with the new approach

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of core foundation components:
   - Implement JSON-based function definitions
   - Create basic node canvas with React Flow

2. Focus on creating a minimal working version quickly with:
   - Limited function set (10-15 functions)
   - Simple data flow connections
   - Basic code generation
   - Export to Python files

## Transition Notes

This progress report reflects our transition to a simplified MVP approach. Previous work on the more complex execution flow system, extensive function library, and advanced code generation features has been put on hold temporarily to focus on delivering a working version quickly.

The simplified MVP will serve as a foundation that we can incrementally enhance with more advanced features based on user feedback and prioritization.
