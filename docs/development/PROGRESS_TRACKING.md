## Completed Items Details

### Function Definitions
- Initial 15 essential Python functions covering:
  - Math operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
  - String operations (concatenate)
  - Control flow (if, for)
  - Conversion (to string, to number, to integer)
  - Logic (greater than, less than)
  - Input/Output (print, input)
  - Lists (create list)
- Additional functions added:
  - Math functions: min, max, abs
  - String functions: split, join, replace
  - List operations: filter, map, sort
  - Dictionary operations: create dict, get item
  - File operations: open, read, write, close, check if exists

### Node System

- Added support for creating connections between nodes
- Implemented drag-and-drop functionality for node creation

### Code Generation
- Implemented code generator that follows node connections
- Created code preview component to display generated code
- Added export functionality to save Python files

### Example Programs

- Updated progress tracking

## Next Steps

After completing the function library expansion, the next steps are:

1. **Add Execution Flow**:
   - Implement the execution flow system
   - Add support for conditional execution

2. **Improve Validation**:
   - Enhance type checking
   - Add more robust connection validation

3. **Add Project Management**:
   - Implement saving and loading projects
   - Add version control features

4. **Polish UI**:
   - Improve visual appearance
   - Enhance user experience

## Success Criteria Status

1. ‚úÖ **Functional**: Users can create simple visual programs and generate working Python code
2. ‚úÖ **Usable**: First-time users can create a basic program (calculator, string formatter)
3. ‚úÖ **Exportable**: Generated code can be exported and run with Python

The simplified MVP is now complete, and we have successfully enhanced it with an expanded function library.
