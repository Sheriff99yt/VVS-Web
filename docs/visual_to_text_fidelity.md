## Summary

VVS follows **text-shaped graphs**: the canvas is a visual editor for **ordinary source structure**. Every node that affects behavior must produce a **visible, locatable artifact** in generated code. The graph teaches and integrates with real toolchains — it does not simulate a proprietary runtime.

> **Fidelity contract:** What you see on the graph is what you could have typed. No compile-time paste, no hidden casts, no latent steps that never appear in text.

This is a **major strategic choice**. It diverges from Unreal Engine Blueprint semantics (macros, latent delays, VM-only execution). That divergence is intentional: Blueprint optimizes for in-engine authoring; VVS optimizes for **export, integration, and third-party adoption**.

## Canvas is the source of truth

**The canvas is the source of truth for generated code.** Project panel symbol tables (`variables[]`, `functions[]`, `events[]`) are **indexes and CRUD shortcuts** — they never emit declarations on their own.

| Concept | Role |
|---------|------|
| **Declare** | Define nodes on the class graph: `class_define`, `var_define`, `function_define`, `event_member_define` |
| **Use** | Usage nodes where logic runs: Get/Set, Call Function, event dispatch, flow nodes |
| **Panel row** | Metadata + navigation; dual-writes a define node when creating or renaming a symbol |
| **Generated line** | Must map to a canvas node via `sourceGraphNodeId` / `sourceMap` |

### Panel action → required canvas correlate

| Panel / tree action | Required on canvas |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| + New variable | `var_define` on class home graph (exec chain) |
| + New function | `function_define` on class home graph |
| + New event | `event_member_define` on class home graph |
| Declare from drop menu | Matching define node at drop position |
| Get / Set / Call in flow | Usage nodes only — symbol must already have a define node |
| Class formation | `class_define` on container graph — required when the home graph has any member define chain |

**Preview vs export:** The code preview may show member-chain body text without a `class Name:` shell when `class_define` was deleted (so authors still see handler order). **Generate** remains blocked with `DEFINE_NODE_MISSING` until Declare is restored on canvas.

If you cannot select a node and highlight the corresponding line in the code panel, the system is wrong.

### Rejected emit paths

| Path | Status |
|------|--------|
| `appendLegacyPreamble` — emit from `ir.variables` / `ir.functions` without define nodes | **Removed** — strict mode only |
| `useLegacyPreamble` fallback when class graph has no define chain | **Removed** |
| Symbol table as codegen source of truth | **Rejected** — canvas define nodes required |
| Hidden event runtime (`_emit`, `_subscribe`, `event_emit`, `event_subscribe`) | **Rejected** — `HIDDEN_EVENT_RUNTIME_UNSUPPORTED` blocks Generate |

Transpiler contract: walk `ir.members` from the define chain via `appendIrMembers` only. Analyzer blocks Generate on `DEFINE_NODE_MISSING`, `DECLARATION_NOT_ON_CANVAS`, and `ORPHAN_DEFINE_NODE`.

**Agent / contributor gate:** Does this PR emit text without a canvas node? If yes — reject.

## Core principles

### 1. Text code is the integration layer

- Generated output runs in **standard** Python, JS/TS, C++, Verse, etc. — no VVS runtime required.
- Users read, diff, grep, debug, and review in their **existing IDE and CI**.
- Graph JSON is the **authoring** artifact; text is what teams **ship and integrate**.

### 2. One visual construct → one honest text construct

| Rule | Example (already shipped) |
|------|---------------------------|
| One conversion node → one call | **To String** → `str(x)` |
| One call node → one call site | **Call Function** → `self.Add()` |
| One dispatch → one visible line | **Dispatch calculate** → `self.on_calculate()` |
| One handler → one method body | **On calculate** → `def on_calculate(self):` |
| Selection → code highlight | `sourceMap` / `expressionSpans` — no re-transpile on select |

**Anti-patterns (forbidden in transpiler):**

- Folding `str()` into Print when the graph has **To String**
- Macro **inline expansion** that duplicates nodes without labeled regions in text
- **Latent / delay** behavior with no matching `sleep`, `await`, or timer in output
- Auto-cast at wire time in codegen (editor may warn; graph must show **Conversion** nodes)
- Hidden event runtime helpers (`_emit`, `_subscribe`, `event_emit`, `event_subscribe`) — use **Declare** + **On** + **Dispatch** (direct call) only

### 3. Reuse = functions and modules, not invisible paste

| Need | VVS approach | Avoid |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Shared logic | **Function** graph + **Call Function** | Blueprint-style macro expand |
| Multi-file | **Import module** / export per graph tab | Duplicated AST at compile time |
| “Snippet here” | **Extract to function** (Ctrl+Shift+E) | Tunnel macros with no text boundary |

**Macro tabs** (legacy UI) are **deprecated as a codegen concept**. They may remain as editor UX during migration but must lower to **named function calls** or explicit include blocks — never silent paste.

### 4. Events and functions follow **text** semantics

| Concept | Visual | Generated text (conceptual) |
|---------|--------|----------------------------|
| **Function** | Sub-graph + Call | `def foo(...): ... return ...` + `foo(...)` |
| **Event handler** | On handler node | `def on_event(self, ...):` |
| **Program entry** | `role: 'entry'` event + define chain | `def on_start(self):` — **only** when user declared entry on the class graph |
| **Event signal** | Dispatch node | `self.on_event(...)` — direct handler call; no hidden `emit` / `_emit` runtime |
| **Lifecycle tick** | On Update node | `on_update` / tick handler — still a visible method when wired |

Sync vs async rules follow **target language**, not a hidden VM:

- **Wait** / **Await Wait** (future) emit explicit wait calls.
- **Wait inside sync function** → analyzer error (same *user-visible* rule as Blueprint, but the **code shows the wait**).

### 5. Third-party integration is a first-class requirement

VVS must embed cleanly in **any** stack:

- npm/pip/cargo projects importing generated files
- CI running generated tests without a graph engine
- MCP agents editing nodes with predictable text diffs
- Game engines, web apps, automation tools — **no vendor lock-in**

Fidelity is what makes third-party integration possible. Hidden transforms make VVS a **plugin for VVS**, not a plugin for **your** product.

### 6. No Hidden Magic (Educational Explicitness)

We **never** automatically inject hidden structural code (like missing module imports, invisible memory allocators, or implicit async wrappers). 

If a dependency is required to make the code compile (e.g., `#include <iostream>` in C++), there must be an explicit **Import Node** or visual module configuration that the user actively manages on the canvas. 

This ensures VVS acts as an **educational tool**. Users learn exactly what is required to make the code work natively. The graph must clearly represent every semantic requirement of the target language, preventing the user from relying on transpiler "magic" that wouldn't translate if they wrote the code by hand.

**Modifiers and keywords:** Visibility, `static`, `virtual`, `override`, `abstract` / pure, `const`, and `async` appear in generated text **only** when set on the corresponding Declare node’s `properties`. The transpiler must not infer class-level keywords from members, invent trait/`Default` impls, or force `override`/`public` defaults that the canvas did not set.

**Language-aware UI:** When the current codegen language does not use a modifier in emit, the editor **disables** that chip (still visible) rather than letting users change a no-op.

## Authoring decision guide

```text
Need reusable logic?
  └─ Returns a value or void?     → Function + Call
  └─ React to a named signal?     → Event Declare + On + Dispatch (explicit line in code)
  └─ Program start (host calls)?  → Entry event (`role: 'entry'`) + event_member_define + event_define on class graph
  └─ Per-frame / tick hook?       → On Update lifecycle node (when target supports it)
  └─ Pause time?                  → Wait / Await Wait node (when shipped) — visible in text
  └─ Copy-paste visual pattern?   → Extract to Function — NOT macro expand
```

## Rejected directions

We evaluated paths common in visual tools (especially Unreal). **We did not adopt them** for reasons below.

### A. Unreal Engine / Blueprint-faithful semantics — **rejected**

**What it is:** Macro compile-time expansion, latent Delay nodes, function vs event VM rules, execution wired like Blueprint, graph as bytecode-like artifact.

**Why we rejected it:**

| Limitation | Impact on VVS |
|------------|---------------|
| **Graph ≠ generated code** | Macro paste and latent actions don’t appear in export — **code panel lies**, learners can’t map visual → text |
| **Proprietary runtime** | Blueprint needs UE VM; generated “code” is not self-sufficient — **cannot integrate as a third-party library** in arbitrary software |
| **Broken native toolchain** | grep, diff, IDE step-debug, unit tests on exported files fail or mislead when behavior lives in latent VM |
| **Multi-language fracture** | Latent macros and exec semantics don’t map to Python/JS/C++/Verse the same way — emitters become hacks |
| **MCP / AI fragility** | Agents can’t predict output when transpiler performs invisible transforms |
| **Vendor coupling** | Adopting BP semantics makes VVS a **Blueprint companion**, not an **open visual language** for all engines and workflows |

**Where that path leads:** In-engine visual scripting with **secondary, untrusted text** — fine for Epic’s ecosystem, **incompatible** with our north star (open platform, git-native integration, bring-your-own stack).

**UE6 plugin note:** The planned plugin uses the **same text-shaped emitter** (Verse output). It may offer familiar **canvas** patterns but **does not simulate Blueprint VM**. Familiar UX ≠ hidden semantics.

---

### B. Graph-as-source-of-truth (code is a lossy view) — **rejected**

**What it is:** JSON graph is the real program; text is preview only, rearranged or optimized opaquely.

**Why we rejected it:**

- Users don’t **own** the mental model of their program in text form.
- Git review of generated files is misleading.
- Contradicts README promise: *integrate with IDE, repo, CI*.

**Where it leads:** Scratch-like or proprietary runtime products — not VVS Web.

---

### C. Strict AST-isomorphic IR (every node = one AST node) — **deferred, not primary**

**What it is:** Formal 1:1 mapping to a language AST; possible future round-trip from text to graph.

**Why not primary now:**

- High design cost before we ship teaching-quality emitters.
- AST shapes differ per language — still need a high-level IR.

**Where it leads:** Research-grade language workbench — valuable later, not the Phase 1 gate. Our **fidelity contract** achieves most user value without full round-trip.

---

### D. “Honest macros” (visible duplicate blocks) — **rejected as default**

**What it is:** Macro use emits labeled copy-paste regions in text.

**Why we rejected it as default:**

- Duplication bloat; two reuse models (function + macro) confuse authors.
- Functions + modules already give honest reuse with **one call line**.

**Where it leads:** Acceptable as an **optional export mode** only if ever needed — not core product semantics.

---

### E. Sync-only forever — **rejected as permanent stance; accepted as Phase 1 scope**

**What it is:** No Wait/Delay until async model is designed.

**Why sync-first is OK temporarily:** Simplest fidelity story; Dual Class Lab and tutorials ship now.

**Where full model leads:** Explicit **async function** flag + **Await Wait** nodes — still text-shaped, not latent VM.

## Implementation alignment

**Shipped (text-shaped):**

- Conversion nodes — explicit calls, `sourceMap` spans
- Call Function — visible methods and calls (macro/`use_macro` removed; migration on load)
- Event Declare + On + Dispatch — visible handler methods and direct call lines (`self.on_<name>(…)`)
- No hidden event runtime — `event_emit` / `event_subscribe` blocked (`HIDDEN_EVENT_RUNTIME_UNSUPPORTED`); transpiler does not inject `_emit` / `_subscribe`
- Import Module — emits at **canvas chain position** with `sourceMap`; place shared imports **once at file top** on the first class chain (`targetLanguages` gate). **Flow** Import Module inside branches for conditional imports (e.g. Python `import json`). Optional `ownerClassId` when scoping is required.
- Member / event order — exec topology first; **event defines are Y-ordered peers** (event→event wires do not force emit order); remaining ties use canvas Y (higher first)
- Wait / Await Wait — explicit sleep/await in export; async function flag
- Pin validation — graph shows type fixes via **Conversion** nodes
- `sourceMap` selection highlight in code panel
- IR pipeline — analyze → lower → emit in `packages/transpiler`

**Canvas-only declarations (strict, July 2026):**

- Define nodes on class home graph are **required** for every symbol — analyzer errors block Generate
- No sidebar preamble — `appendIrMembers` / `ir.members` only
- Panel create paths **dual-write** define nodes (`defineNodeSync`)

**Legacy (migration on load only — not emit fallback):**

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| `event_emit` / `event_subscribe` | Legacy graphs may still contain nodes — analyzer blocks Generate; kinds excluded from spawn catalog |
| `event_dispatch` | Supported — lowers to direct handler call |
| Macro tabs in old saves | Migrated to function tabs on load |
| Sidebar preamble (`appendLegacyPreamble`) | **Removed** — strict canvas-only emit |

## Agent & contributor checklist

Before adding nodes, transpiler lowering, or UI copy:

- [ ] Does every new behavior node have a **named, highlightable** generated construct?
- [ ] Would a user **grep** the export and find what the graph shows?
- [ ] Does this require a **VVS runtime** to behave as drawn? If yes — redesign.
- [ ] Are we copying Blueprint **semantics** without Blueprint **honesty in text**? If yes — reject.
- [ ] Is reuse implemented as **Call Function**, not invisible expand?
- [ ] Does every emitted declaration or statement originate from a **canvas node** with `sourceMap` coverage? (No sidebar preamble.)
