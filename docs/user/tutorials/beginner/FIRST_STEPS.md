## Introduction

VVS Web is a visual programming system that allows you to create Python programs by connecting nodes rather than writing code. This makes programming more accessible and helps you avoid syntax errors while still learning important programming concepts.

In this tutorial, you'll create a simple "Hello, World!" program that:
1. Takes a name as input
2. Combines it with a greeting
3. Prints the result

## Understanding the Interface

When you first open VVS Web, you'll see a workspace divided into several areas:

![VVS Web Interface](../../images/interface_overview.png)

- **Node Library Panel** (left): Contains all available function nodes organized by category
- **Canvas** (center): The main workspace where you'll create and connect nodes
- **Properties Panel** (right): Shows properties of the selected node
- **Code Preview** (bottom): Shows the Python code generated from your visual program
- **Toolbar** (top): Contains actions like save, export, and undo/redo

Take a moment to explore these areas before proceeding.

## Creating Your First Node

Let's start by creating an input node to get the user's name:

1. In the Node Library panel, find the "Input/Output" category and click to expand it
2. Find the "Input" node and drag it onto the canvas
3. Select the node on the canvas
4. In the Properties panel, set the "Prompt" property to "Enter your name:"

Your input node is now configured to ask the user for their name when the program runs.

## Adding More Nodes

Next, let's add two more nodes to our program:

1. From the "String" category, drag a "Concatenate" node onto the canvas
2. From the "Input/Output" category, drag a "Print" node onto the canvas
3. From the "String" category, drag a "Create String" node onto the canvas
4. Select the "Create String" node and set its value to "Hello, "

Your canvas should now have four nodes: Input, Create String, Concatenate, and Print.

## Connecting Nodes

Now let's connect these nodes to create our program flow:

1. Click and drag from the output port (circle on the right) of the "Input" node to the second input port on the "Concatenate" node
2. Connect the output port of the "Create String" node to the first input port on the "Concatenate" node
3. Connect the output port of the "Concatenate" node to the input port of the "Print" node

Your visual program should now look something like this:

![Connected Nodes](../../images/hello_world_connected.png)

## Viewing Generated Code

Once your nodes are connected, VVS Web automatically generates the corresponding Python code. Look at the Code Preview panel at the bottom of the screen to see your program:

```python
# Generated by VVS Web
name = input("Enter your name:")
greeting = "Hello, "
result = greeting + name
print(result)
```

This is the Python code equivalent of your visual program.

## Saving Your Project

To save your project:

1. Click the "Save" button in the toolbar (or press Ctrl+S)
2. Enter a name for your project (e.g., "HelloWorld")
3. Click "Save"

Your project is now saved and can be reopened later.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've created your first visual program with VVS Web. Here's what you've learned:

- How to navigate the VVS Web interface
- How to add nodes to the canvas
- How to connect nodes to create a program flow
- How to view the generated Python code
- How to save your project

In the next tutorial, [Building a Simple Calculator](./CALCULATOR_TUTORIAL.md), you'll learn how to create a more complex program that performs mathematical operations.
