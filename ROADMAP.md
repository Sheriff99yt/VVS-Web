# VVS Web Project Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for VVS Web, a visual programming system that transforms the way users write code through an intuitive node-based interface.

## Current Focus: Moving to Execution Flow Implementation

**Current Development Status**: We've successfully completed the Simplified MVP plan and expanded the function library with mathematical, string, list, dictionary, and file operations. We're now moving to the next phase of enhancement: implementing the execution flow system. See the [Progress Tracking](docs/development/PROGRESS_TRACKING.md) document for detailed status.

## Project Phases Overview

- [x] Visual node system with React Flow
- [x] Basic Python code generation
- [x] Export functionality for Python files
- [x] Example programs and documentation

### Phase 3: MVP Enhancement (Current Focus)
- [x] Expand function library with additional Python functions (COMPLETED)
  - [x] Mathematical functions (min, max, abs)
  - [x] String manipulation functions (split, join, replace)
  - [x] List operations (filter, map, sort)
  - [x] Dictionary operations (create dict, get item)
  - [x] File handling functions (open, read, write, close, exists)
- [ ] Add execution flow system (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Improve type validation and connection handling
- [ ] Implement project saving/loading
- [ ] Polish UI and user experience

### Phase 4: Multi-Language Support (Upcoming)

- [ ] Advanced node interactions

### Phase 5: Polish and Optimization (Planned)
- [ ] Performance improvements
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Advanced code generation features
- [ ] Complete documentation

## Review Points

Reviews should occur:
- At the end of each phase
- When implementing critical features
- After significant refactoring
- Before adding new languages
- When performance issues are identified

## Notes

- This roadmap is a living document and will be updated as the project evolves
- Priorities may shift based on user feedback and technical discoveries
- Early phases focus on functionality over polish
- Testing should be integrated throughout development
- Documentation should be updated in parallel with code
