- Connections between nodes now have improved visual representation with animations based on socket types
- Error handling for invalid connections has been implemented with toast notifications
- Test coverage has been expanded to include UI components, with tests for the CustomEdge and GraphEditor components
- GraphEditor tests successfully implemented using component mocking to avoid ReactFlow rendering issues
- Connection error handling tests have been implemented to verify proper error management
- Socket type based coloring has been implemented, enhancing the visual clarity of the node graph and making it easier for users to identify compatible connections
- A socket type legend has been added to help users understand the color coding system
- Socket input widgets now seamlessly integrate with the code generation system, providing default values when sockets aren't connected and ensuring consistent behavior across all node types
- Node documentation has been implemented with two key components:
  - Built-in descriptions for each node type that explain what the node does
  - User-editable comments that appear as properly formatted comments in the generated code
- Comments in the Details panel are clearly labeled to indicate they will appear in the generated code
- The code generator now automatically formats and inserts comments above the code for each node
- Multi-language code generation has been implemented with support for Python, TypeScript, C++, Java, and Go
  - A central language registry manages all language configurations
  - Each language is defined via configuration objects, keeping language syntax separate from generation logic
  - A universal code generator uses language configurations to format code appropriately for each language
  - The Monaco editor correctly applies language-specific syntax highlighting
- A reusable language selector component has been created and integrated in:
  - The code preview panel for selecting the output language
  - The main toolbar for easy access from anywhere in the application
- Tests have been implemented for the language selector component to ensure proper functionality
- The entire multi-language code generation system now works seamlessly with the existing visual scripting interface
