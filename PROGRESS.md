## Key Features Implemented

### Node Creation System
- **✅ Node Factory Pattern**: Centralized node registration in `NodeFactory.ts`
- **✅ Node Templates**: Template system for all node categories
  - Math operations (`MathOperationTemplate.ts`)
  - Logic operations (`LogicOperationTemplate.ts`)
  - Control flow (`ControlFlowTemplate.ts`)
  - Variables (`VariableTemplate.ts`)
  - I/O operations (`IOTemplate.ts`)
- **✅ Organized Definition Files**: One file per node category
- **✅ Template-based Registration**: Consistent pattern across all node types
  1. Define typed configuration objects 
  2. Create nodes from configurations
  3. Register nodes using template-specific functions

### Multi-Language Code Generation
- **✅ Language Configuration System**: Standard interfaces for syntax templates
- **✅ Language Registry**: Central management of supported languages
- **✅ Universal Code Generator**: Single generator supporting multiple languages
- **✅ Supported Languages**: Python, TypeScript, C++, Java, and Go
- **✅ Language-specific Formatting**: Proper syntax for operations, literals, and escaping
- **✅ UI Integration**: Language selection in code preview and toolbar

### Socket System Enhancements
- **✅ Socket Type Coloring**: Visual differentiation between socket types
- **✅ Input Widgets**: UI controls for setting default values
- **✅ Widget Types**: Checkboxes, number inputs, sliders, dropdowns, text areas
- **✅ Validation**: Type checking and value constraints
- **✅ Connection Feedback**: Visual indicators for compatible connections

### UI Improvements
- **✅ Properties Panel**: Floating panel for editing node properties
- **✅ Side Panel**: VS Code-inspired tabbed interface
- **✅ Theme System**: Comprehensive light and dark mode
- **✅ Socket Type Legend**: Visual guide for socket colors
- **✅ Node Descriptions**: Built-in documentation for nodes
- **✅ User Comments**: Editable comments that appear in generated code

## Outstanding Issues

### UI
- Improve visual consistency across components
- Enhance node positioning and layout

### Testing
- Implement comprehensive test coverage for remaining components
- Create integration tests for full workflow validation

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Node Library**:
   - Add remaining essential node types using the template system
   - Create documentation generators based on configurations
   - Implement test utilities for node validation

2. **Enhance Socket Input Widgets**:
   - Improve validation for input values
   - Better visual integration with node design
   - Add support for more input types
   - Implement contextual inputs based on node type

3. **Polish UI and UX**:
   - Add keyboard shortcuts
   - Refine interactions and animations
   - Implement additional user experience improvements
   - Complete documentation

4. **Expand Testing**:
   - Implement remaining component tests
   - Create integration tests
   - Test with diverse node combinations
   - Validate multi-language code generation

5. **Code Cleanup and Optimization**:
   - ✅ Removed deprecated code generation files
   - ✅ Cleaned up unused language-specific generators
   - Optimize performance-critical sections
   - Reduce bundle size by removing unused dependencies
   - Implement code splitting for better load times
