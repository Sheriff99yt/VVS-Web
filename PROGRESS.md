- [x] Test the code generation with complex node graphs
- [x] Create node connection and validation logic
- [x] Implement data flow between connected nodes
- [x] Improve visual representation of connections between nodes

### Phase 3: Essential Features
- [x] Implement properties panel for viewing node properties
- [x] Add support for editing node properties
- [ ] Implement complete node library with all essential node types
- [x] Add error handling for node connections
- [x] Implement workspace panning and zooming
- [x] Add ability to delete nodes and connections

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing
- [ ] Refine UI and interactions
- [ ] Optimize performance for basic operations
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- [ ] Add help tooltips for UI elements
- [x] Set up Jest and React Testing Library for testing
- [x] Create test mocks for external dependencies (Chakra UI, ReactFlow)
- [x] Implement unit tests for socket system
- [x] Implement unit tests for base node component
- [x] Implement unit tests for graph state management
- [x] Implement unit tests for code generator
- [x] Implement tests for main UI components (GraphEditor, CustomEdge)
- [ ] Implement tests for additional UI components (NodeLibrary, PropertiesPanel, CodePreview)
- [ ] Implement integration tests for the complete application flow
- [ ] Test the application with different node combinations
- [ ] Fix identified bugs and issues

## Outstanding Issues

1. **UI Issues**:
   - ~~Chakra UI v3 provider integration issue~~ (Resolved)
   - Need to improve the visual consistency across components

2. **Functionality Issues**:
   - ~~Code generation is only partially implemented~~ (Resolved)
   - ~~Node property editing is not yet implemented~~ (Resolved)
   - Node positioning and layout could be improved
   - ReactFlow rendering issues in test environment (Workaround implemented)

3. **Testing Issues**:
   - SVG elements causing console errors in test environment (Non-blocking)
   - Need to implement more comprehensive test coverage for remaining components

## Next Steps

1. ~~Complete the implementation of all node types and their code generation~~ (Completed)
2. ~~Test the code generation with complex node graphs~~ (Completed)
3. ~~Add support for editing node properties~~ (Completed)
4. ~~Improve the visual representation of connections between nodes~~ (Completed)
5. ~~Implement proper error handling for invalid connections~~ (Completed)
6. Continue expanding test coverage for UI components (In Progress)
   - ~~Added tests for CustomEdge component~~ (Completed)
   - ~~Created test structure for GraphEditor component~~ (Completed)
   - ~~Successfully implemented tests for GraphEditor component using component mocking~~ (Completed)
   - Need to implement tests for NodeLibrary, PropertiesPanel, and CodePreview components
7. Create integration tests for full workflow validation
8. Implement remaining essential features:
   - Workspace panning and zooming
   - Node deletion functionality
   - Improved node positioning


## Notes
- The code generation now supports all node types and produces valid Python code
- Node properties can now be edited through the properties panel
- Connections between nodes now have improved visual representation with animations based on socket types
- Error handling for invalid connections has been implemented with toast notifications
- Test coverage has been expanded to include UI components, with tests for the CustomEdge and GraphEditor components
- GraphEditor tests successfully implemented using component mocking to avoid ReactFlow rendering issues
- Connection error handling tests have been implemented to verify proper error management
