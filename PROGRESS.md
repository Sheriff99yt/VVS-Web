## Notes
- The code generation now supports all node types and produces valid Python code
- Node properties can now be edited through the properties panel
- Connections between nodes now have improved visual representation with animations based on socket types
- Error handling for invalid connections has been implemented with toast notifications
- Test coverage has been expanded to include UI components, with tests for the CustomEdge and GraphEditor components
- GraphEditor tests successfully implemented using component mocking to avoid ReactFlow rendering issues
- Connection error handling tests have been implemented to verify proper error management
- Socket type based coloring has been implemented, enhancing the visual clarity of the node graph and making it easier for users to identify compatible connections
- A socket type legend has been added to help users understand the color coding system
- Multi-language code generation is being implemented to allow users to generate code in Python, TypeScript, and C++
