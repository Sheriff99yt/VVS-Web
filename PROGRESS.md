- Test coverage has been expanded to include UI components, with tests for the CustomEdge and GraphEditor components
- GraphEditor tests successfully implemented using component mocking to avoid ReactFlow rendering issues
- Connection error handling tests have been implemented to verify proper error management
- Socket type based coloring has been implemented, enhancing the visual clarity of the node graph and making it easier for users to identify compatible connections
- A socket type legend has been added to help users understand the color coding system
- Socket input widgets now seamlessly integrate with the code generation system, providing default values when sockets aren't connected and ensuring consistent behavior across all node types
- Node documentation has been implemented with two key components:
  - Built-in descriptions for each node type that explain what the node does
  - User-editable comments that appear as properly formatted comments in the generated code
- Comments in the Details panel are clearly labeled to indicate they will appear in the generated code
- The code generator now automatically formats and inserts comments above the code for each node
- Multi-language code generation has been implemented with support for Python, TypeScript, C++, Java, and Go
  - A central language registry manages all language configurations
  - Each language is defined via configuration objects, keeping language syntax separate from generation logic
  - A universal code generator uses language configurations to format code appropriately for each language
  - The Monaco editor correctly applies language-specific syntax highlighting
- A reusable language selector component has been created and integrated in:
  - The code preview panel for selecting the output language
  - The main toolbar for easy access from anywhere in the application
- Tests have been implemented for the language selector component to ensure proper functionality
- The entire multi-language code generation system now works seamlessly with the existing visual scripting interface
- All component tests have been fixed and are now passing, including:
  - Socket component tests now check for socket wrappers with title attributes instead of text content
  - BaseNode component tests have been updated to work with the current implementation
  - CustomEdge tests have been updated to match the actual component behavior
  - LanguageSelector tests now properly check the select element's style
  - All tests for the UniversalCodeGenerator are passing, confirming proper code generation for all supported languages
- Fixed code nesting in the UniversalCodeGenerator to properly handle indentation and block structures:
  - Resolved an issue with duplicate colons in Python code blocks
  - Improved the addBlockStart method to avoid adding block start characters when they're already present
  - Enhanced tests for nested code structures to verify proper indentation in all supported languages
  - All nested code structure tests are now passing, confirming correct handling of complex nested control flows

- Enhanced the Socket Input Widget system for improved integration with code generation:
  - Implemented a more comprehensive widget type system with support for:
    - Sliders for numeric ranges with visual feedback
    - Dropdowns/select menus for enumerated options
    - Color pickers for visual color selection
    - Multi-line text areas for longer input strings
  - Improved widget value formatting in code generation:
    - Type-specific formatting based on widget configuration
    - Better precision control for numeric inputs
    - Support for multiline text with proper escaping
    - Special handling for color values
  - Added contextual widget selection based on data type:
    - Numbers can use slider or numeric input
    - Strings can use single-line or multi-line text areas
    - Enumerated types can use dropdown selectors
  - Enhanced validation for input values with min/max constraints
  - Better visual integration with the node design
  - Fixed infinite recursion bug in the formatting system by properly separating widget and default value formatting

## Added NOT Logical Operator and Enhanced Language-Specific Formatting

- Added the `NOT` logical operator to the node system:
  - Added `NOT` to the `NodeType` enum
  - Added `NOT` to the `LOGIC` category in `NODE_CATEGORIES`
  - Created a new `NOT` node template in the `NodeLibrary`
  - Added `not` operator templates to all language configurations

- Enhanced language-specific value formatting:
  - Added `values` and `escapeSequences` properties to the `LanguageConfig` interface
  - Updated all language configurations with appropriate values for boolean literals and escape sequences
  - Modified the formatting methods in `UniversalCodeGenerator` to use language-specific values
  - Improved multiline text handling with language-specific newline characters

- Fixed code generation for mathematical and logical operations:
  - Implemented the `processMathOperation` method to handle binary operations
  - Added special handling for the unary NOT operation
  - Ensured consistent socket naming across all operation nodes

These improvements ensure that the code generator produces correctly formatted code for all supported languages, with proper syntax for logical operations, string literals, and boolean values.

## Fixed Socket Input Widget State Synchronization

- Fixed issues with some socket input widgets not properly updating graph values:
  - Added state synchronization in the Socket component to ensure local widget state stays in sync with node data
  - Enhanced the BaseNode component to update both socket defaultValues and node properties consistently
  - Improved the UniversalCodeGenerator to check multiple sources for input values (properties and socket defaultValues)
  - Ensured consistent value paths throughout the application for better stability

These fixes improve the reliability of input widgets across all node types and ensure that changes made through the UI are correctly reflected in the generated code.

## Fixed "undefined" Values in Socket Input Widgets

- Fixed socket input widgets that were displaying "undefined" values:
  - Added proper handling of "undefined" string values in Socket component
  - Updated all input widget types to properly display default values instead of "undefined"
  - Enhanced UniversalCodeGenerator to convert string "undefined" to appropriate type defaults
  - Improved formatDefaultValue method to handle "undefined" string values correctly
  - Ensured generated code never contains literal "undefined" values
  
These enhancements provide a better user experience by ensuring all widgets show meaningful values rather than "undefined", and improve code generation quality by preventing undefined values from appearing in the generated code.

## Enhanced Logical and Mathematical Operation Nodes

- Improved input widgets for all logical operation nodes (AND, OR, NOT, GREATER_THAN, LESS_THAN, EQUAL):
  - Added explicit widget types for all inputs (CHECKBOX for boolean inputs, NUMBER for numeric inputs)
  - Set appropriate labels for boolean inputs to improve clarity
  - Added reasonable min/max constraints for numeric inputs (-1000 to 1000)
  - Configured precision and step values for better numeric control
  
- Enhanced mathematical operation nodes (ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE):
  - Added explicit NUMBER widget type to all inputs
  - Set appropriate min/max constraints to prevent extreme values
  - Configured precision (2 decimal places) for consistent numeric representation
  - Improved step values (0.1) for fine-grained control

These enhancements provide a better user experience when working with operation nodes, ensuring inputs have appropriate constraints and widget types for their intended purpose.

## Fixed Math and Logic Nodes Input Widget Values in Generated Code

- Fixed issues with mathematical and logical nodes not showing input widget values in generated code:
  - Updated the `processMathOperation` method in UniversalCodeGenerator to use the correct socket IDs ('a' and 'b')
  - Fixed the NOT operation to use the 'input' socket ID instead of the incorrect 'input1'
  - Added initial property values in node templates to ensure values are immediately available
  - Created consistent naming between socket IDs, socket names, and property keys
  - Ensured all operation nodes have default values set in both sockets and properties

These fixes ensure that input widget values for all mathematical and logical operation nodes (ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE, AND, OR, NOT, etc.) are properly reflected in the generated code, resolving the issue with "undefined" values appearing in the output.
